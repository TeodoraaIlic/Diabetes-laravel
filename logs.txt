            with filtering (ingrediants, calories, etc,...) **** without ingrediants

                                1. pulling all the userratings that are related to this recipe and then
                                    everytime page is reloaded to again calculating the rating (BAD OPTION FOR PERMANCE)
                                2.  add a new column inside Recipe and calculating rating when recipe is being made or edited and save value to new column
                                    On this way we dont have to do calculation everytime
